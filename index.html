		<!-- About Me Info -->
		<p><section>Local Austinite, and "Jill of All Trades," Hannah has worked in various industries, such as Customer Service, Restaurant, Sales, & Consulting. She graduated in good standing from St. Stephen's Episcopal High School, and finished Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor's in Psychology from St. Edward's University. More recently, Hannah has found herself chasing her passion of Movement/Dance, while pursuing a complementary career in Web Development.

		 <section>In the last 3 years, Hannah has made a career for herself out of her passion for Dance. She first fell in love with this style of movement when she stumbled upon Kizomba. Prior to dancing, Hannah spent years intensely studying yoga asana, meditation, and anatomy under Shanti Kelley, and taught Alignment Based Vinyasa classes in Austin, TX. Hannah is 500 hour certified in AB Vinyasa.

		<section>Through years of training and hard work, she has gained international recognition. Hannah has taught and performed across the US, and in Mexico.  Currently, Hannah focuses on improving her understanding and technique of Kizomba and Brazilian Zouk so that she may better serve her community, students, and the overall growth of her two favorite dances.

		<section>Hannah is also currently pursuing a continued education with Web Development at The University of Texas's Coding Bootcamp. Hannah has always enjoyed creating and designing, and spent countless hours in the art studio throughout high school. Hannah has dabbled in design over the past few years, but decided to seriously dive in more recently. Hannah plans to continue studying and growing, with the hopes of finding Development (or related) work, to complement the work she has already made for herself.
